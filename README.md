# Demographic Data Analyzer 📊

## 🌟 Overview
This is my second project from the **Data Analysis with Python** certification by freeCodeCamp. In this project, I used **Pandas** to analyze a dataset of demographic data extracted from the 1994 Census database.

## 🧠 Key Questions Answered
I wrote Python code to extract insights such as:
- How many people of each race are represented?
- What is the average age of men?
- What is the percentage of people who have a Bachelor's degree?
- What is the highest-earning country and its percentage?
- Identify the most popular occupation for those who earn >50K in India.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: (Optional if you added plots later).

## 📈 Learning Journey
This project helped me solidify my understanding of:
1. **Boolean Indexing**: Filtering data based on complex conditions.
2. **Data Aggregation**: Using `value_counts()` and `mean()`.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Handling categorical data for statistical analysis.
